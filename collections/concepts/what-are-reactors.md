# What Are Reactors?

Reactors are foundational to your ability to make your data more usable within your application. 
Instead of accessing sensitive data within your own system and executing your own queries and procedures on that data, our Reactor platform allows code to be executed against your data without the data ever leaving our secure and compliant environment. 
Reactors grant you the freedom to choose how you want to enrich and process your data without needing to worry about security or compliance.
