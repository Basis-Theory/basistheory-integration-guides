# Use U.S. Bank Accounts without touching them

    This guide will quickly enable you to be compliant with new Nacha Encryption rules. 
  </span>
</span>

Safely storing bank account data in a way that enables your entire organization to safely use, is no small feat. It takes a strong encryption pattern, including a KMS, key rotation, multiple encryption keys, access controls, and so much more. 

In this guide, we will show you how to quickly collect and secure your customers' U.S. Bank Account information with Basis Theory. You'll learn how to collect the data using our Elements, toknize the information, and use our Serverless Reactor platform to communicate with Spreedly to obtain a Payment Method. 

If you'd like to follow along with this guide jump right into our sample app - <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Basis-Theory/basis-theory-js-examples/tree/master/collect-banks-with-elements?from-embed=&file=/public/index.html">Find it here!</a>

## Add Elements to your website

<span class="base-alert warning">
  <span>
    To start, you'll need a new Public Application with the <code>token:create</code> permission granted to the `/bank/` container. 
    <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?application_template_id=d3ea55c1-4008-4703-9d52-db078ca5e245" target="_blank">Click here to create one.</a>
  </span>
</span>

First, add two new `div` tag elements to your HTML. These will serve as a place to attach two separate Element tags for both Routing Number and Bank Account.

```html
    <div class="row row-input" id="routing_number"></div>
    <div class="row row-input" id="account_number"></div>
```

Second, you'll need to add the following javascript code to your application to mount each element:

```js 
  await BasisTheory.init(ELEMENTS_KEY, {
    elements: true,
  });

  let routingNumber = BasisTheory.createElement('text', {
    ...options,
    targetId: 'routingNumber',
    placeholder: 'Routing Number',
    'aria-label': 'Routing Number',
  });
  let accountNumber = BasisTheory.createElement('text', {
    ...options,
    targetId: 'accountNumber',
    placeholder: 'Account Number',
    'aria-label': 'Account Number',
  });

  await routingNumber.mount('#routing_number');
  await accountNumber.mount('#account_number');
```

Finally, you'll see two new Elements appear on your page. Next, we will tokenize the data entered into them!

## Create a Bank token from your new Elements
Creating tokens with our Elements is as easy as if you're passing raw text. 


To create a [Bank](https://docs.basistheory.com/api-reference/#token-types-bank) token, you'll just need to pass the token's type (bank) and the Element references from Step 1 into the `tokens.create` method.

```js
const token = await BasisTheory.tokens.create({
  type: 'bank',
  data: {
    routing_number: routingNumber,
    account_number: accountNumber
  }
});
```

You now have a new Bank token assigned to `token` - typically the `id` and `mask` of this token is stored within your database which allows you to read back the data at a later date.


## Set up a Spreedly Reactor

Configure one of our pre-built Reactor Formulas, enabling you to quickly exchange raw bank data for a processor token (e.g. Spreedly - Bank).


To set up a Reactor, head over to our Portal and set up a new Spreedly Reactor. If you're looking for step-by-step guide on how to set up a Reactor, head over to our [guide](/guides/setup-your-first-reactor).


## Using your new Reactor 
<span class="base-alert warning">
  <span>
    To use your new Spreedly Reactor, you'll need a <code>Private</code> Application with the 
    <code>token:use</code> and <code>token:create</code> permissions granted to the `/bank/` container. 
    <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?application_template_id=7754ec77-2312-494f-afac-044c63b92bbc" target="_blank">Click here to create one.</a>
  </span>
</span>

Once youâ€™ve created your Spreedly Reactor, use the <code>reactor_id</code> and your Bank token's ID to exchange for a new Spreedly Payment Method token, enabling you to charge your customer.

```js

const reactorResponse = await bt.reactors.react(REACTOR_ID, {
  args: {
    card: `{%raw%}{{${token.id}}}{%endraw%}`
  }
});

return reactorResponse;

```

With your Spreedly Payment Method in hand, you can store this within your own platform and avoid becoming dependent on Basis Theory for your future transactions. As soon as you need a new Payment Method, just call the `/react` endpoint for that reactor with your token id, and you'll have a newly attached token.


## Wrap up

Now that you understand the basics of using our Elements and Bank tokens to collect and charge a customer, you have the ability to easily use your encrypted Bank token in any way you'd like:

- Use our Serverless Reactors to create an ACH file (if you're looking to do this, [reach out!](https://basistheory.com/contact))
- Quickly begin securing and using raw bank data yourself with our API
- Interact with any other banking service you can imagine (e.g. Dwolla, Plaid, etc)
- [Style our Elements to look exactly like your own application](/guides/style-elements-for-my-brand/)
