                            <p>Tokens are the core of the Basis Theory platform, built to enable companies to remove the need to store sensitive data while granting the flexibility they need to grow and operate their business. Our tokens enable you to either own the encryption keys yourself, or pass raw data to our platform and we will handle keeping it safe for you.</p>

                            <p>To understand how to implement Basis Theory we are pleased to offer you this 10-step guide. If you donâ€™t want a guide and just want to see it work, run on over to the sandbox. If you want to go right to postman to test you can use our official library hosted here. For those of you who want a technical guide, here is an excellent way to get started testing Basis Theory end to end.</p>
